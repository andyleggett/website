Andy is great to work with and we will certainly be working with him again in future. He sets clear expectations of his timelines in advance, providing a very honest and accurately broken out quote, and exceeds them, producing a very high standard of work.

On this project, Andy brought considerable front-end development expertise across a range of technologies. Most of the pages were asynchronous, using AJAX requests, to improve user experience, which is always Andy's top priority, and is very well received by our users. Highly recommended!
