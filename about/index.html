		<h2 class="about-banner">I'm a Front End Developer with over 10 years commercial experience on the web.</h2>
		<p>I enjoy combining HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript and various backend technolgies to create websites and web applications with clean and maintainable code for happy clients.</p>
		<p>When I'm not working, you'll find me and my little dog climbing the nearest mountain to my home in Stirling, Scotland  - whatever the weather!</p>

		<p>Creating websites that really deliver a great experience is tough and constantly evolving.  I use the latest workflows and techniques such as progressive enhancement and responsive layouts to produce sites that work across all devices.</p>
		<p>I write code that is easy to read and maintain.  It is semantic and cross-browser compatible. It is also as fast as I can make it so that your users are as happy as possible.</p>

	<p>It's important to understand the full stack of development.  I just as happy dealing with databases and server languages and node.js bridges a gap here.</p>
	<p>I know that in business the speed of your site or application is paramount to user engagement and something to take extremely serious for Search Engine Optimisation. Waiting for a slow backend is not an option.</p>

		<p>Modern tools allow developers to spend more time on the actual essence of the application rather than dealing with the mechanics of coding.</p>
		<p>I employ many of these in my day-to-day work including Grunt, Bower, Sass and Git.</p>
		<p>I also use tools like Jekyll to produce the right kind of site - if it doesn't need a database you won't get one!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="about-right">
		<p>Workflow isn't just about tools.  It's also about communication and people</p>
		<p>Having clients as part of the flow means that no one is left in the dark about what is happening in a project and I make it easy for clients to give me feedback and evolve projects.</p>
